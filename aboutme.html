		<p>Hello and welcome to The Website I have created for the Web Design and User Interface for the HDip in Computing in DIT.</p>
		
		<p>My name is Gavin McCoy and I am born and bred in Newbridge, County Kildare, Ireland.</p>

		<p>My background is originally in Chemistry. I graduated from Dublin City University with a BSc in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences. 
		After graduating, I worked in Pfizer Grange Castle for over two years in the Quality Control department.</p>

		<p>Working there, I gained a huge range of skills. It enabled me to be a fantastic team player by helping others with any problems they may have 
		faced as well participating in whiteboard meetings. I know that whiteboard meetings are often an integral part of the IT industry and it is something 
		I am quite comfortable with and enjoy taking part in.</p>

		<p>While the pharmaceutical industry offer numerous opportunities, I felt that the IT industry offered more and with a natural aptitude for computers, 
		it seemed like a no-brainer to make a career change. I started the HDip in Computing in DIT in February 2015 and I have never looked back. 
		It was definitely the best decision of my life. I have improved my leadership skills through a group assignment for Systems Analysis and Testing 
		where I also learned a great about UML and can now understand any UML diagram you could throw at me as well as doing quite a good job at created my own.
		I have also studied Databases, Object-orientated Programming, Web Design, Computer Architecture and more.</p>

		<p>Well, I could tell you more, and I will, but I guess but I think Iâ€™ll leave it there and let you explore the rest of the website. </p>

		<p>Email me at <b>gavin[dot]mccoy2[at]mail[dot]dcu[dot]ie</b> for any questions you might like to ask. Maybe to arrange an interview perhaps?</p>
