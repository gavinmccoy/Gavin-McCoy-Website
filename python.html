		<p>Python was the programming language chosen by DIT for the Objected-orientated Software Development module and while it would not have been my 
		first choice at the time, I think DIT made the right decision selecting it as it is simple to use, great for prototyping, multi-paradigm and multi-platform 
		and I have no doubt that Python will be heavily involved in the Internet of Things as the Raspberry Pi revolution indicates.</p>
	
		<p>Below is some of the first code I wrote in Python. Obviously it is not 100% original by any means but it involves the Haversine formula which is incredibly 
		useful for any mobile apps involving geolocation. It turned out that we would be using a variation of the same formula for our main Python college assignment
		so I guess I got lucky.</p>
