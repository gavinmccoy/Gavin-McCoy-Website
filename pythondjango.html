			<p>When I realised that we were going to be learning Python, I had a look at the job specs for Python developers and it seemed that a framework was
			often used with Python and the most popular one seemed to be Django. Django was not taught in DIT so I had to teach myself.</p>
	
			<p>At the moment I working through a book called Lightweight Django available on O’Reilly Press and I am eager to get my hands on another book called 
			Hands-On Django which will be available on O’Reilly Press in August 2015. The Django framework not only incorporates Python but also JavaScript, HTML 
			and CSS so I would be a fool not to get elbow-deep in it.</p>
	
			<p>Below is the models.py from my attempt at the famous Django Polls App tutorial. I was quite proud when I finished it and got it working and I am 
			looking forward to working on more Python/Django projects.</p>
